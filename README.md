# file-server
A very simple file server, to serve the files on local network without having to install nodejs.


Just download and launch the .exe file from [here][1] and it will start the file server on port 99, on the directory in which you placed this EXE file. It will not require NodeJS.

You can also define your own port as the first command line argument, like:
`>file-server-x64-v1.0.exe 8080`

Upon launching it, if Windows does not prompt you for a firewall entry for it, then you will need to turn of Windows firewall or add port/app exception for it manually.
